# This sample creates a simple InnoDB Cluster with help from the MySQL Operator.
# This yields:
#   3 MySQL Server Pods; one primary and two secondaries
#   1 MySQL Router Pod
# It uses self-signed TLS certificates.
# It requires a deployed Operator (e.g., deploy/deploy-operator.yaml),
# and requires root user credentials provided by a Kubernetes Secret;
# the Secret is named mypwds in this case (e.g., sample-secret.yaml)
